### Approach: Selecting rows based on conditions

#### Algorithm

The keyword `SELECT` is used to specify the columns that we want to retrieve from the table `Products`. In this scenario, we want to retrieve the `product_id` column.

The keyword `WHERE` is used to filter the rows in the table `Products` based on specific conditions, which the `low_fats` column has the value "Y" (indicating low-fat products) and the `recyclable` column has the value "Y" (indicating recyclable products). We use the logical operator `AND` to combine both conditions, ensuring that the final result includes only product IDs for products that are both low fat and recyclable.

#### Solution

```
SELECT
    product_id
FROM
    products
WHERE
    low_fats = 'Y'
    AND recyclable = 'Y';
```
