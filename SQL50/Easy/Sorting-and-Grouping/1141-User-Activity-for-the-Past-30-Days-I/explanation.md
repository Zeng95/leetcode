## Solution

### Overview

The two keys for solving this question are:

1. select a specific date range
2. count only distinct users as there are users having more than one activity per day, and the final results are grouped by day.

There are several ways to select a specific range of dates:

1. manually calculate the date and use this date in the filter to get the range. For this question, the result is looking for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27, which is all the days between 2019-06-28 and 2019-07-27:

```sql
activity_date > '2019-06-27' AND activity_date <= '2019-07-27'
```

or using `BETWEEN`:

```sql
activity_day BETWEEN '2019-06-28' AND '2019-07-27'
```

The date '2019-06-28' is used here because the BETWEEN operator is inclusive, and the begin and end values are included.

2. [DATEDIFF(date1, date2)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_datediff): this function returns date1 - date2 expressed as a value in days from one date to the other, so there is no need to calculate the exact date for the filter:

```sql
DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date)<30
AND
DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date)>=0
```

the first condition checks that `date2` is within `30` days of `date1`. The second condition checks that `date2` does not occur after `date1`. Without the second condition, a negative difference is also '<30', and we will get dates after 2019-07-27 in this case

Another way to use DATEDIFF:

```sql
DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) BETWEEN 0 AND 29
```

3. [DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL expr unit)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_date-add): this function performs date arithmetic, if the syntax does not support adding or subtracting days directly using operators such as '+' or '-':

```sql
activity_date BETWEEN date_sub('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY)
AND '2019-07-27'
```

### Approach:

#### Algorithm

1. Select the columns needed for the final output: the dates, and the number of distinct users for each date.
2. Add the filter for the date range. Make sure you are familiar with at least one method to pull the date range correctly with minimum calculation.
3. Group the results by the activity date.

#### MySQL

```sql
SELECT
    activity_date AS day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM
    Activity
WHERE
    DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) < 30 AND DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date)>=0
GROUP BY 1
```
